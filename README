Changes since Milestone #2:

[!]	- USER MANUAL has been updated for the GUI games explaining all the games and
	the engine.
[!] - A .jar file is created, which runs a game selector allowing the User to easily
	select a game to play at the beginning, and when exiting another game.
	- A general graphical representation of the game was developed. It is functional
	for all games as it simply displays the content of playingField.
	- The controller is a ButtonHandler which reacts to any tile on the board being
	pressed.
	- The pipes game is now a fully functional game. As images allows rotations to be
	viewable, further testing and development was made to the game.
	- The PacMan game now has three different personalities for each Ghost on the board.
	One of the ghosts has a personality which causes it to flee from PacMan when he
	becomes invulnerable. This makes the game more interesting.
	- New map for MouseLand which should allow more challenging play.
	
Known issues and roadmaps:

	- We will be adding a JMenuBar which will have the following JMenus:
		(Game) which will have JMenuItems:
			(New Game) restarts the game
			(Level Code) allows user to input a level code which loads a certain game level
			(Undo) allows 4 undos
			(Redo)
	- Since more levels will be required, it would be more ideal to have levels in text files,
	and so it will be easier to load and create new levels (rather than hardcoding in java)

Changes since Milestone #1:

[!]	- [all] the classes are working properly in a text based representation. In
	order for this to become a reality, many changes were brought to the Class
	Diagram, including added/removed methods/variables.
	- A controller was created for each game, allowing user input for interaction
	with the game.
	
Known issues and roadmaps:

	- The PacMan game will eventually implement three different personalities for
	Ghosts, which will prevent the ghosts from clustering to the same tile and
	consequently becoming boring opponents. Ideally, ghosts should flee PacMan while
	he is invulnerable as well...
	- The Pipes game is difficult to represent in a Text based game: Since the tiles
	are represented as letters, it is not possible to display a rotated pipe. Thus
	ensuring that the rotated pipes work means drawing on paper the expected layout.
	- The next step involves designing a GUI based game for our classes, which means
	images will be drawn. As for the controller, it should not differ much from our
	text based controller.

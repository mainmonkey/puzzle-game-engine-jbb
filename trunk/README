Changes since Milestone #2:

[!]	- USER MANUAL has been updated for the GUI games explaining all the games and
	the engine.
[!] - A .jar file is created, which runs a game selector allowing the User to easily
	select a game to play at the beginning, and when exiting another game.
	- A general graphical representation of the game was developed. It is functional
	for all games as it simply displays the content of playingField.
	- The controller is a ButtonHandler which reacts to any tile on the board being
	pressed.
	- The pipes game is now a fully functional game. As images allows rotations to be
	viewable, further testing and development was made to the game.
	- The PacMan game now has three different personalities for each Ghost on the board.
	One of the ghosts has a personality which causes it to flee from PacMan when he
	becomes invulnerable. This makes the game more interesting.

Changes since Milestone #3:

	- USER MANUAL has been updated for the games explaining the level sequence
	- A general graphical representation of the game was developed for Android. It is
	functional for all games.
	- The screen is the controller, where buttons are displayed and the MENU button can be
	pressed to find the undo/redo buttons.
	- Three new levels for each game, played sequentially.
		- In PacMan, the levels loop forever until you lose all your lives, accumulating as
		many points as possible.
		- In MouseLand, the levels are played sequentially, and the player will win when he
		beats the final level.
		- In Pipes, the levels are played sequentially, and the player will win when he beats
		the final level.
	- The undo/redo buttons are implemented such that you may undo forever and redo forever.
	
Known issues:

	- When Pacman is invulnerable he is white, but when you click undo, he goes back to yellow
	until you click again, then he will be back white.
	-If you set a mousetrap and a mouse walks over it, the mousetrap image has blood 
	splatter on it and the trap cannot be used. If you click undo, it will still be unable to kill 
	a mouse BUT the image is set to original image.
	-If you click on an invalide move it still counts as a turn, so when you click undo it "undos" 
	the invalide move therefore nothing will change, until you clicks undo as more times than click on
	an invalide move
	-If you complete a level, and right away you undo, then bet it again, you will skip a level.
